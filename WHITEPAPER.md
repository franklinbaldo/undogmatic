# Whitepaper: Hubris Detection for Legal LLMs: A Style+Evidence Signal and Reward Framework

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) in legal applications often exhibit hubris—defined here as rhetorical overconfidence coupled with weak evidential grounding, such as unsubstantiated appeals to authority lacking analytical depth. This is distinct from a truth oracle; UNDOGMATIC does not verify factual accuracy but flags stylistic and structural overreach. This whitepaper introduces UNDOGMATIC, a lightweight framework for detecting and mitigating hubris via a composite **ShameScore**, operationalizing "shame-based sentiment" as professional embarrassment: outputs that a lawyer would hesitate to submit due to assertive claims without sufficient analysis. Integrating semantic similarity to prototype centroids (ShameStyle), normative violation flags (ShameNorm), and latent miscalibration signals (ShameReliability), it enables alignment through LoRA fine-tuning and RLHF reward penalties. Bilingual support (English/Portuguese) targets U.S. and Brazilian legal contexts. Preliminary toy-data experiments show discrimination (ShameScore: 0.45 hubris vs. -0.32 humility), with extensions for token-level feedback and citator integration (e.g., Shepard's/KeyCite). This advances safer legal AI by promoting undogmatic reasoning.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Hubris Problem in Legal AI

Legal reasoning demands nuance: precedents require contextualization with holdings, scopes, counter-authority, and subsequent history to avoid appeals to undue authority (argumentum ad verecundiam). LLMs, tuned for fluency over caution, generate hubristic outputs—e.g., categorical claims via bare citations or boosters like "clearly," sans hedges like "arguably." Benchmarks show frequent overconfidence and hallucinations in legal tasks (e.g., 58–88% hallucination rates). In low-agreement cases, such as ambiguous judicial interpretations, LLMs amplify risks with authoritative tone minus verification.

This manifests as "shame-based sentiment": not psychological embarrassment, but professional shame—rhetorical overreach + weak evidential grounding, where outputs assert too much with too little, risking embarrassment in submission. Probabilistic calibration (e.g., logit entropy) misses rhetorical signals like unexamined deference to outdated mandates or tendentious citation spins. UNDOGMATIC quantifies a three-part hubris signal—style, norms, and reliability—to foster humility in applications like contract review and case prediction. Unlike generic sentiment analysis (predicting mood valence), this targets legal craft norms: authority-tone without sufficient analysis.

### 1.2 Contributions

- **ShameScore**: Fused metric from embeddings (style), rule-based flags (norms), and confidence estimators (reliability).
- **Alignment Hooks**: LoRA for classifiers; RLHF rewards penalizing overconfidence, with anti-gaming (e.g., hedge caps).
- **Bilingual Design**: English/Portuguese lexicons and prototypes for U.S./Brazilian jurisprudence.
- **Open Prototype**: Codebase with LexGLUE/LegalBench evals, including pairwise labeling for quick annotation.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Overconfidence in Legal LLMs

Benchmarks like LexGLUE assess entailment/summarization but underexplore calibration. LegalBench and LEXam reveal reasoning gaps, with LLMs overconfident in ambiguous queries. Hallucinations occur in 58–88% of cases, often authoritatively phrased. Mitigations include Thermometer for uncertainty flagging and chain-of-thought for bias, but rhetorical hubris endures. Verbalized confidence (tone) often misaligns with latent confidence (e.g., entropy), exacerbating "authority without analysis."

### 2.2 Calibration and Overconfidence

Metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, and risk-coverage curves quantify overconfidence. Hedging/epistemic modality detection traces to Hyland (1998), with NLP advances via CRF models on CoNLL-2010. Selective abstention and verifier/critic methods (e.g., Constitutional AI, RLAIF) address gaps, but legal-specific fusions with citation structure are novel.

### 2.3 Alignment

RLHF induces verbalized overconfidence; reward calibration (e.g., via PPO) tames it. LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning (~1% parameters). Gap: Legal humility rewards, including anti-gaming for hedge spam.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Shame Signals

UNDOGMATIC extracts a three-part signal from text (optionally with precedent summaries), processed at sentence/segment level (sliding window of 2–3 sentences). Outputs must include: Issue, ControllingAuthority, CounterAuthority, SubsequentHistory, Reasoning. Bilingual prototypes/lexicons support EN/PT (extendable via YAML).

- **ShameStyle**: Cosine similarity of mean-pooled embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, multilingual for PT) to centroids from prototype banks (6–10 paraphrases each):
  - Embarrassing/Overreach: e.g., "This precedent definitively resolves the matter; there is no contrary authority." (EN); "É inequívoco; não há autoridade em sentido contrário." (PT).
  - Professional/Undogmatic: e.g., "It likely applies, but scope and subsequent history must be checked." (EN); "Provável, mas é necessário avaliar autoridade contrária e histórico posterior." (PT).
  - ShameStyle = sim(text, EmbarrassingCentroid) − sim(text, ProfessionalCentroid). High = embarrassing tone.

- **ShameNorm**: Rule-based flags for normative violations (lawyerly embarrassments):
  - Bare citation (regex for U.S./BR formats, <50 words explanation) → +1.
  - No counter-authority in contested issues → +1.
  - No subsequent history if citator flags negative treatment (undisclosed) → +1.
  - Booster ≫ Hedge ratio (>0.01 normalized) → +1.
  - Categorical absolutes ("undeniably," "sem divergência") without reasoning → +1.
  - ShameNorm = (flags_triggered / flags_possible), normalized [0,1]. Anti-gaming: Cap hedge credit (≤2 per 100 words); require Reasoning/CounterAuthority for bonuses; penalize empty hedge spam.

- **ShameReliability**: Latent miscalibration (confidently wrong vibes):
  - Low entropy: \( H = -\sum p_i \log p_i \) (normalized low → 1).
  - Top-k logit margin: \( \max(p) - \sum_{k-1} p_j \) (large + low agreement → high).
  - Self-consistency variance: Std. dev. over n=5 few-shot samples (high variance → 1).
  - Verifier disagreement: Cosine diff. from critic model/retrieval (high → 1).
  - ShameReliability = average of normalized components [0,1].

### 3.2 ShameScore

Tunable linear fusion:

\[
\text{ShameScore} = \alpha \cdot \text{ShameStyle} + \beta \cdot \text{ShameNorm} + \gamma \cdot \text{ShameReliability}
\]

Defaults: \(\alpha=0.4, \beta=0.4, \gamma=0.2\) (YAML-configurable; raise \(\beta\) for structure emphasis). Positive/high = shame (embarrassing overreach).

Thresholds:
- OK (≤0.15): Proceed as-is.
- Caution (0.15–0.35): Add hedges/counter-authority/history checks.
- Block (>0.35): Abstain or enforce structured fill (Issue/Authority/etc.).

### 3.3 Modules

- `SentenceEncoder`: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (multilingual for PT).
- `HubrisSignaler`: Extracts signals (reuse for ShameNorm).
- `ShameScorer`: Computes composite (see implementation snippet in Section 7).
- `HubrisReward`: \( r = -\lambda \max(0, \text{ShameScore} - m) \) (\(\lambda=1.0, m=0.1\)); tune via grid; additive with factuality/helpfulness in PPO. (Tracks closely with prior HubrisScore.)
- `train_lora_hubris_classifier`: PEFT LoRA on BERT-base-multilingual (epochs=3, r=8) for binary shame.

Adversarial variant: Train discriminator on shame; generator minimizes via RL. Token-level: Recompute on last sentence during generation.

## 4. Datasets and Labeling

Data pipeline: Mine cases (e.g., CAP for U.S.; STF/STJ for BR). Heuristics pre-label: bare-cite vs. explained; booster-heavy vs. hedged; history omission (e.g., flag if citator shows negative treatment ignored). Human guide (EN/PT): Pairwise preferences—"Which would be embarrassing to submit as a lawyer?" (A vs. B; 300–800 pairs for LoRA bootstrap). Binary: 1=shame (overreach + weak evidence), 0=humility (hedged + counters). Targets: 1–5k items; 80/10/10 split. Privacy: No sensitive data; encourage local processing.

## 5. Evaluation

- **Calibration**: ECE, Brier, risk-coverage.
- **Shame**: % authority-only answers; history/counter-engagement rates; human correlation (r>0.7 target, via pairwise prefs).
- **Ablations**: Style-only vs. norm-only vs. reliability-only vs. combined; ±legal hooks/citators; ±anti-gaming.
- **Moot-Court**: Practitioner A/B win-rate/acceptability.
- **Multi-Jurisdiction**: Separate EN/PT thresholds; ROC curves.

Toy F1=0.82 (n=500, seed=42; illustrative—full setup in README; CIs via bootstrap).

## 6. Ethics and Anti-Gaming

Cap hedge credit/repetitive use; require substantive Reasoning for bonuses; penalize spam ("maybe... perhaps..."). Mitigate false positives (e.g., justified certainty) via human-in-loop, threshold tuning per jurisdiction. Not legal advice; augments human review. Recalibrate for drift; version models. Risk: Over-penalizing bold but sound arguments—monitor via practitioner feedback.
